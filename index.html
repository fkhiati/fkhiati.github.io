      <h3>Research Statement</h3>
      <p>
  			My research interest lies in the area of natural language processing(NLP) where I have worked on statistical approaches and computational models to
        extract semantic information from text. I am particularly interested in closing the gap between commonly spoken languages like English or other
        European languages, for which there exist an abundance of NLP resources and technologies, and minority languages that often lack even the most basic
        NLP resources and tools such as Arabic and Korean.
      </p>
      <p>
        During my masters, I worked at the Intelligent Information System Laboratory(IIS Lab) as research/student assistant. My research area was focused on
        NLP tasks and Machine Learning while I prepared myself to pursue a doctorate. In the laboratory, I was involved in several projects such as The Brain
        Korea 21 Plus(BK21+), a human resource development program funded by the Korean Ministry of Education.
        My master thesis was about retrieving snippets from search engines and embedding them using Latent Semantic Analysis(LSA), then clustering the
        output vectors using Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering(AHC). I published a paper on that by the end of my master; the general idea behind the
        publication was to explain how to use LSA e􀃕ciently for clustering purposes and topic analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
  			My frst year of doctoral studies, I was part of the Semantic Web Research Center(SWRC) at KAIST. During that time, I completed several tasks that
        extracted knowledge from resourceful languages, such as English, and transfered it to a less resourceful one such as Korean or French. One of my main
        tasks was Entity Linking. The entity linking module is a statistical model that relied on a knowledge base(KB) to extract entities from text and identify
        them as a person, organization, or place, and then link them to their corresponding links in the KB. Most of these entities are very ambiguous, and thus
        they need a strong model to make sure every entity is correctly linked using its context. I also took part in a Hackathon called Open Knowledge Base and
        Question-Answering(OKBQA) that has been around for the past 3 years and consists of knowledge base construction and application. My contribution
        was the integration of the Entity Linking to the platform, which has been used on the Question Answering task. I have also adapted a stat-of-the-art
        Entity Linking model called AGDESTIS on the korean language for comparison purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the second year of my doctorate, I shifted my focus to a less application oriented laboratory and thus I have joined the Users and information
        Laboratory(U&I Lab). My current research topic is about multi-lingual word embedding, where we embed several languages into a single space and
        from that space we could retrieve relatedness between two tokens. Using this method I have been able to collaborate with other researchers to work on
        different tasks such as topic analysis. One of the current collaborations involves clustering political tweets from three different languages(English,
        French, German) and then analyse the results to and politicians that have similar point of views.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, my goal is to work on new languages and develop/improve new techniques that could serve as a bridge between researches on different
        languages from machine translation to all sort of other NLP tasks that rely on multilingual environment.
